I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?

I was part of something special. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Checkmate... So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?

What do they got in there? King Kong? Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose.
