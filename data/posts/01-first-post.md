# A really Cool Blog Post

This is some mark down and all that good shit. Look at me! This is pretty cool isn't it? Going to test some other stuff while I go along.

## More stuff

So, this is pretty cool. But I was able to create this blog in just about 2-3 hours of total dev time. Now I get to spend some time making this a bit prettier. I used a solid [guide](https://dev.to/tinacms/creating-a-markdown-blog-with-next-js-52hk) along with the official docs to get set up and couldn't be happier. It provided me with a relatively scalable solution to handle the few blog posts I intend to publish.

Coming up next, going to clean up some styles and then add a way to view my photos via instagram.

Woo!
